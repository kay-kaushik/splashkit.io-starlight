To contribute a function usage example, you need to create the following files:

- **Text file** (.txt) containing a title and short description of the example.
- **Image file** (.png) (or **Gif file** (.gif) if the example code is interactive) showing the expected output of the example.
- **Code file** with the example code. This must be a complete code example, not just a snippet of code.

## File Naming

To allow the files to be used to automatically generate the usage example MDX page, you need to follow a specific format when naming your files.

Here is an example of files for two code examples added into the `write_line` folder that are demonstrating the use of `void write_line(string line);

```text
write_line-1-hello-world.cpp
write_line-1-hello-world.cs
write_line-1-hello-world.png
write_line-1-hello-world.txt
write_line-2-ascii-art-charlie-the-unicorn.cpp
write_line-2-ascii-art-charlie-the-unicorn.cs
write_line-2-ascii-art-charlie-the-unicorn.png
write_line-2-ascii-art-charlie-the-unicorn.txt
```

Breaking down the first line from above:

```text
write_line-1-hello-world.cpp
    ^      ^      ^       ^
    |      |      |       |
    |      |      |       -----: file type: .cpp
    |      |      |
    |      |      -------------: example name: hello-world
    |      |                     (hyphenated: use dash `-` between each word,
    |      |                     no spaces in filenames)
    |      |
    |      --------------------: number id of example: -1-
    |                            (used to create the order of examples)
    |
    ---------------------------: folder name: write_line
                                 (created using the "unique_global_name" key
                                 from SplashKit's "api.json" file)
```

## File Contents

### Text file

The text file needs to include:

- Name of the example program, using a level 3 markdown heading, `###`.
- Short description of what the example code is demonstrating, with a hyperlink to the function's API Documentation details.

Here is an example of the contents of the `write_line-2-ascii-art-charlie-the-unicorn.txt` file:

```text
### ASCII Art - Charlie the Unicorn

The following code is an example of using [Write Line](/api/terminal#write-line-5) to create ASCII art of "Charlie the Unicorn" in the terminal.
```

### Image of Gif file

Add a screenshot of the output of the example program.

If the example program includes user input or any movement, please create a Gif showing the program running.

Remove identifying details from the image/gif where possible.

### Code file(s)

Please follow the guidelines below:

- All of the example code needs to be in a single file.
- One file per language, with a **minimum of C++ and C# code files** added.
- Example code should be able to be run by copying the code into an empty code file.
